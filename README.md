# Libft
A simple library to use in projects, ***re-writing some of C standard functions***, in order to understand how they work and how to use them. I added some functions that I used in my other projects during my cursus.

It includes implementations of 
- strlen()
- strcat()
- strcpy()
- strcmp()
- memcpy()

among other things
*This library isn't optimized and has one only purpose : **pedagogy**.*
